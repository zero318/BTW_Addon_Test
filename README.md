¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

This project *should* compile just by adding the BTW code and invoking `gradlew.bat build` to compile the src/main/java folder.
The batch scripts that convert src/main/javac into src/main/java won't work without editing preprocess.bat to point to a valid C preprocessor (yes, I know it's cursed).
