Features

Slime Blocks:
- Crafted from 9 slime balls as a packing recipe
- Uncrafted with a stoked cauldron
- Mined with a shovel
- Interact with pistons the same way that they do in modern vanilla
- Don't stick to glue blocks
- Entities are slowed down when walking on top, bounces entities when pushed, prevents fall damage when not sneaking
- Can indefinitely support adjacent blocks that would otherwise need mortar
- Can be used with pulleys/platforms to move blocks
- Bounce entities when placed by a block dispenser

Glue Blocks:
- Crafted from 4 glue as a packing recipe
- Uncrafted with a stoked cauldron
- Mined with a shovel
- Interact with pistons similarly to honey blocks
- Have a slightly smaller hitbox than most blocks
- Don't stick to slime blocks
- Entities are slowed down when touching, prevents fall damage
- Can indefinitely support adjacent blocks that would otherwise need mortar
- Can be used with pulleys/platforms to move blocks

Observers:
- Crafted at a soul forge similar to buddy blocks, but replacing the redstone torches with quartz
- Retain the vanilla behavior of detecting block "shape" changes rather than block updates

CUD Block:
- Crafted via a shapeless recipe combining a comparator and a buddy block
- A buddy block variant that detects comparator updates

Block Breaker:
- Obtained by cutting a block dispenser in half
- Picks up blocks when receiving a pulse of power

Block Placer:
- Obtained by cutting a block dispenser in half
- Places blocks when receiving a pulse of power

/noclip Command:
- Sort of like spectator mode, but worse
- Make sure you're already flying in creative mode or you'll just fall into the void

Changes
///
Most BTW Blocks:
- Follow standard redstone power rules
- Block dispensers and pulleys can be quasi powered

Buddy Blocks:
- Detect block placement
- Disabled detection of comparators and pistons
- Redstone dust only connects to the output face

Cistern:
- Has a hollow hitbox

Soap Blocks:
- Given the properties of glazed terracotta

Metal Spikes:
- Conduct power into the block they're attached to
- (This uses the 4th metadata bit)

Platforms:
- Connect to other platforms when moved by pistons
- Fixed broken code that prevented lifting redstone/rails

Pistons:
- Completely rewrote the implementation of block/entity pushing
- Attempted to make moving blocks match their normal collision
- Suffocate entities that're clipped inside
- Fixed MC-1230 (No longer let entities clip through moving blocks)

Note Blocks:
- Interact with oberservers like in modern versions
- (This uses the 1st and 2nd metadata bits)

Rails and other movable blocks that need support:
- Should no longer break when pushed in most situations

Tile Entities:
- Mostly no longer get reinitialized when quickly pushed by a piston

Blocks Requiring Support:
- Mostly follow modern support rules

Chests:
- Can't form triple chests when quickly pushed by a piston
- Double chests stick together when pushed (admittedly to fix a rendering bug)

Redstone dust:
- Renders properly on top of transparent blocks
- Fixed MC-2255, MC-8645, and MC-9405

Comparators:
- Renders properly on top of transparent blocks
- Front torch in subtract mode lowered to match modern comparator
- Enabled rotation on turntables
- Fixed placement from block dispensers
- Fixed MC-8911, MC-10653, MC-12211, MC-63669, and MC-195351

Repeaters:
- Renders properly on top of transparent blocks
- Fixed MC-9194

Debug Features (No recipes and more broken)
///
Iron Trapdoor:
- Was added as a way of creating a single tick block update that could be pushed

Pull Only Test Block:
- A block similar to glazed terracotta that can only be pulled instead of only pushed.

Dead Coral Fan:
- Added as a way of verifying that the update order of pistons was being handled correctly
- If you know, you know :)

///
Planned Features
///
- Giving slime/glue meaningful functionality with turntables
- Finishing iron trapdoors to have a recipe and work properly
- Adding an iron fence gate

///
Known Issues
///
- Block dispensers placing slime blocks doesn't bounce players
- Slime/glue have kinda broken rendering just because 1.5.2
- Slime blocks don't bounce entities that fall on them despite having code for it
- Players touching the south/bottom of a glue block have glitchy interactions with the "can't see when inside a solid block" mechanic
- The CUD block recipe sucks
- Sloped rails don't flatten out when the rail they're connected to is moved down by a piston
- Block placers/breakers have lazy texturing
- Metal spikes don't receive power from repeaters
- Exploit with platforms
