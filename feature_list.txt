Features
///
Slime Blocks:
- Crafted from 9 slime balls as a packing recipe
- Interact with pistons the same way that they do in modern vanilla
- Don't stick to glue blocks
- Entities are slowed down when walking on top, bounces entities when pushed, prevents fall damage when not sneaking
- Can indefinitely support adjacent blocks that would otherwise need mortar

Glue Blocks:
- Crafted from 4 glue as a packing recipe
- Interact with pistons similarly to honey blocks
- Have a slightly smaller hitbox than most blocks
- Don't stick to slime blocks
- Entities are slowed down when touching, prevents fall damage
- Can indefinitely support adjacent blocks that would otherwise need mortar

Observers:
- Crafted at a soul forge similar to buddy blocks, but replacing the redstone torches with quartz
- Retain the vanilla behavior of detecting block "shape" changes rather than block updates

CUD Block:
- Crafted via a shapeless recipe combining a comparator and a buddy block
- A buddy block variant that detects comparator updates

///
Changes
///
Pistons:
- Completely rewrote the implementation of block pushing

Soap Blocks:
- Given the properties of glazed terracotta

Rails and other movable blocks that need support:
- Should no longer break when pushed in most situations

Tile Entities:
- Mostly no longer get reinitialized when quickly pushed by a piston

Chests:
- Can't form triple chests when quickly pushed by a piston

Comparators:
- Enabled rotation on turntables
- Fixed placement from block dispensers
- Fixed MC-8911, MC-10653, MC-12211, MC-63669, and MC-195351

Repeaters:
- Fixed MC-9194

///
Debug Features (No recipes and more broken)
///
Iron Trapdoor:
- Was added as a way of creating a single tick block update that could be pushed

Pull Only Test Block:
- A block similar to glazed terracotta that can only be pulled instead of only pushed.

Dead Coral Fan:
- Added as a way of verifying that the update order of pistons was being handled correctly
- If you know, you know :)

///
Planned Features
///
- Giving slime/glue meaningful functionality with turntables
- Finishing iron trapdoors to have a recipe and work properly
- Adding an iron fence gate
- Adding a /noclip command

///
Known Issues
///
- All new blocks are listed in the creative menu twice
- Slime/glue have kinda broken rendering just because 1.5.2
- Slime blocks don't bounce entities that fall on them despite having code for it
- Glue blocks are conductive and allow placing blocks that require support on them (tempted to make this a feature though, since that sucks about honey)
- Players touching the south/bottom of a glue block have glitchy interactions with the "can't see when inside a solid block" mechanic
- Entities standing near the edge of a glue block aren't moved properly. Works properly if standing between two glue blocks.
- The CUD block recipe sucks
- Observers are conductive
- Sloped rails don't flatten out when the rail they're connected to is moved down by a piston
- /noclip seems to not work on the serverside?
